# Introduction
Create and manage Accounts that hold any type of asset on Radix (including the platform's native `XRD` token) displayed beautifully so you understand what you own at a glance. Create Personas to easily login to Radix dApps with one click. The Radix Wallet always makes sure that you're in control, with easy-to-understand transactions and clear dApp permissions so there are no surprises.

The Radix Wallet takes advantage of the advanced native features of the Radix Network. That means totally decentralized, non-custodial access to what you own; you always have direct access without any company in the middle.
