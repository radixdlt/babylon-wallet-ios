	/// This allows to create partial instruction which are then build once put together.

	/// - Building a manifest with dynamic number of instructions, requiring a `for-loop`
	/// - Building a manifest that has conditional logic to add certain instructions, requiring to use `if-else` statements.
	///
	/// If the manifest you are trying to build does not require additional logic, simply use the `ManifestBuilder()`.
