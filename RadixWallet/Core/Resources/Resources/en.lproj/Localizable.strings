You can unstake the XRD later to get them back – and you’ll find that you accumulated extra XRD in the meantime.\n\nThe extra XRD you earn is proportional to how much XRD you stake, and is often called an “APY” (annual percentage yield).\n\nYou can stake, unstake, and check on your validators and APY returns using the [Radix Dashboard](?glossaryAnchor=dashboard) dApp.\n\nStaking is a great way to put your XRD to work and earn a return, but it’s **not simply free money**. Choosing validators is like voting for who will run the Radix Network. If you choose a bad validator, you might help slow down the network or even help attack it. And you might not get the APY you expect.\n\nGet started with the links below before you stake a meaningful amount of XRD.\n\n[Introduction to Radix staking](https://learn.radixdlt.com/article/start-here-radix-staking-introduction) ↗\n\n[Learn how to choose validators](https://learn.radixdlt.com/article/how-should-i-choose-validators-to-stake-to) ↗";

That’s much different from typical webpages and other apps today. For example, to access your money, you have to do it through a banking or payments app. Your login to every website is owned by that website, or else you use something like your Google login, which is owned by Google.\n\nBut in web3, you can hold your money in an [account](?glossaryAnchor=accounts) that you control directly with a [wallet](?glossaryAnchor=radixwallet) app, and you can create your own [login](?glossaryAnchor=personas) in your wallet app and use that in many places.\n\nDoing things that way is “decentralized” – and it means that websites and applications need to be built specially to interact with wallet apps, self-owned accounts, and self-owned logins. That’s what makes them dApps.\n\nIn the end, web3 dApps can do many things that were never possible before. For example, a [decentralized exchange](?glossaryAnchor=dex) dApp can let you instantly swap between two different kinds of assets right from your wallet in just a tap.\n\n[Visit the Radix dApp Ecosystem Page](https://www.radixdlt.com/ecosystem) ↗";
"infoLink_glossary_guarantees" = "## Deposit Guarantees\n\nSome Radix [transactions](?glossaryAnchor=transactions) may have unpredictable results. In these cases, deposit guarantees make sure you never get less than you expect when you do a transaction.\n\n---\n\nFor example, the result of a swap between assets using a [DEX](?glossaryAnchor=dex) depends on a current market price of the assets involved. You may see one price when considering the swap, but it typically changes by the time the network processes it. Deposit guarantees protect you by letting you specify a minimum amount that must be deposited to your account at the end of the swap transaction.\n\nTo make this possible, the [Radix Network](?glossaryAnchor=radixnetwork) app and [Radix Wallet](?glossaryAnchor=radixwallet) work together. The wallet will show you whenever a deposit to your account is “estimated” rather than of a known quantity. And whenever that\'s true, you can set your own “guarantees” in the wallet on those estimated deposits – putting a limit on how much you expect to get for you to be willing to go through with the transaction. If that guarantee isn\'t met at the time the transaction is processed, the deal is off!

The [Radix Network](?glossaryAnchor=radixnetwork) makes it possible to use ownership of a token or NFT to authorize the holder to access to certain [dApp](?glossaryAnchor=dapps) functionality. Tokens or NFTs used in this way are referred to as “badges”, indicating that only the holder of the badge can use it for authorization.\n\nWhen a badge is used to authorize access in a [transaction](?glossaryAnchor=transactions), you will see it listed in the [Radix Wallet’s](?glossaryAnchor=radixwallet) summary of the transaction under “presenting”.

"infoLink_glossary_poolunits" = "## Pool Units\n\nPool units are fungible [tokens](?glossaryAnchor=tokens) that represent the proportional size of a user\'s contribution to a liquidity pool\n\nPool units are redeemable for the user\'s portion of the pool but can also be traded, sold and used in DeFi applications.\n\n---\n\nLiquidity pools play an integral role in lending and swapping on DeFi platforms. They work by liquidity providers (LPs) contributing tokens to a pool, thus creating a market for people to lend, borrow and swap. In return, these LPs receive tokens to show they\'ve made a contribution to the pool. LPs usually get rewarded for their contributions in the form of fees paid by the people using the DeFi platform to swap and borrow crypto, but there are other ways for them to earn revenue.\n\nWith other wallets on other blockchains, this process raises risks. Other wallets can’t tell an LP what the tokens they received for providing liquidity are worth. Other wallets can’t even be sure they are actually tokens that represent a portion of a pool or that the tokens are redeemable. They don’t provide any confidence.\n\nThe [Radix Network](?glossaryAnchor=radixnetwork) solves this with a native package called a “pool”. This package automatically implements the logic of minting and burning pool units in the proportion to other LPs’ contributions. It also means your [Radix Wallet](?glossaryAnchor=radixwallet) can always read what your pool units are worth and ensures they’re always redeemable for tokens from the liquidity pool.\n\n[Learn more about pool units](https://learn.radixdlt.com/article/what-are-pool-units-or-native-lp-tokens) ↗";

Each gateway will connect your wallet to a particular network. The Radix Network (known as “mainnet”) is the primary network where all real assets, including the real XRD of value, are located. However a gateway might target a test network (like “Stokenet”) where developers can experiment with updates and new features before they go live on Bablyon. None of the assets on these test networks, including XRD, have any value.\n\nThe [Radix Wallet](?glossaryAnchor=radixwallet) comes automatically connected to a Radix Network mainnet gateway operated by the creators of the Radix Wallet, but there are community-run gateways that users can choose to use as well.

The size of network fees reflect the burden each transaction puts on the network.\n\n**Royalties**: These are set by developers who deploy code or run applications on the network. Royalties allow developers to collect a “use fee” every time their work is used as part of a transaction.\n\n**Tips**: These are optional payments users can make directly to validators to prioritize their own transactions during periods of high network demand. \n\n[Learn more about transaction fees](https://learn.radixdlt.com/article/how-do-transaction-fees-work-on-radix) ↗";

One of the great benefits of this is that assets – tokens and NFTs – are native to the ecosystem. So unlike on networks such as Ethereum, where tokens are not really tokens but just balances on a smart contract, assets on Radix act like real-life assets. With real-life assets of different kinds, you know who can create it, destory it, take it away from you or freeze it within your bank account. Similarly with Radix, you’ll always know how assets will behave and what someone can do to them.\n\nWhen anyone creates a token or NFT on Radix, there is a list of behaviors they can apply to them. Things like being able to increase the token’s supply, being able to change an NFT’s image and description, or being able to remove a token from someone’s account. There are plenty of valid reasons for why someone might want to do these things, but it’s always good to know if they can. \n\nJust tap into any token in the Radix Wallet to get a full list of its behaviors.\n\n[Learn more about the asset behaviors ↗](https://learn.radixdlt.com/article/what-are-radix-asset-behaviors)";

It is underpinned by blockchain technology and is intended to give users more control over their online assets, identity, and data.\n\n---\n\nIn the beginning, the web was all about just viewing content produced by other people. Here’s a webpage, look at it, click it. That was Web1.\n\n**Web2** made it possible for users to create their own content online. Social media, social news, photo sharing, and more became possible – communicating on the web became a 2-way street\n\nHowever, parts of the web are still a 1-way street. While we have control of what we create and share, we don’t have control over _what we own_ and _who we are_. Your money and everything you can do with it is still locked inside separate bank or payment apps, and your logins are specific to every website (if not controlled by Google or Apple or Meta).\n\n**Web3** now adds the ability for users to own their own digital assets and digital identities online, and allows websites and other applications to interact with these truly digital-native assets and identities in powerful new ways.\n\nCryptocurrencies like Bitcoin were the very beginning of web3, but it goes so much further. In web3, “Decentralized Finance” becomes possible, making finance cheaper, better, and more accessible to anyone – financial services compete to put your money to work, rather than charging you for the privilege of holding it. And new things become possible; imagine logging out of your favorite game, but taking your equipment with you to trade with others directly, outside the game?\n\nThis new capability is generally enabled by blockchain technology, but it is in its early days.

There are a variety of dApps that provide bridging in different ways, for different assets.\n\nSometimes bridging involves converting an asset into a different form that can live on Radix. For example, dollars (USD) in your bank account might be bridged into Radix and become xUSDC tokens in your Radix Wallet. Or your Bitcoin (BTC) might be bridged into xwBTC tokens.\n\nSometimes bridging works as a swap, similar to a [DEX](?glossaryAnchor=dex). In this case you might swap one asset outside Radix for a different asset within Radix. Maybe you swap ETH (on the Ethereum network) for XRD tokens (on the Radix Network) at a current market price.";
"infoLink_glossary_payingaccount" = "## Why your Accounts will be linked\n\nPaying your transaction fee from this Account will make you identifiable on ledger as both the owner of the fee-paying Account and all other Accounts you use in this transaction.\n\nThis is because you’ll sign the transactions from each Account at the same time, so your Accounts will be linked together in the transaction record.";
"infoLink_glossary_preauthorizations" = "## Pre-authorizations\n\nPre-authorizations are a way for a [dApp](?glossaryAnchor=dapps) to request your authorization to do something specific with your accounts and assets. When you approve a pre-authorization, it is provided to the dApp which can use it to create a [transaction](?glossaryAnchor=transactions) on the Radix Network.\n\n---\n\nA pre-authorization request looks very similar to a transaction request in your wallet. In both cases, you get to review exactly what\'s going to happen with your own accounts and assets.\n\nHowever, after you sign a pre-authorization, it is not submitted directly to the Radix Network like a transaction request. Instead, it is provided back to the dApp that requested it. The dApp can then include that pre-authorization in a transaction that it creates and submits.\n\nThis makes it possible for dApps to do helpful things, such as:\n\n• Pay the [transaction fees](?glossaryAnchor=transactionfee) for you.
• Do transactions involving multiple people.
• Mint a badge or NFT and directly deposit it to your account.\n\nIn all of these cases, the dApp still needs you to approve and sign any interactions with your accounts and assets - the Radix Network guarantees it.\n\nBecause the pre-authorization is provided back to the dApp, there is a time limit how long it lasts. Once this time limit is up, the pre-authorization expires and can\'t be used. A dApp will need to make a request for another one. You can see how long you have until your pre-authoirzation expires in the pre-authorization summary.";
